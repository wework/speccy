<p>Speccy ships with two rulesets, <code>default</code> and <code>strict</code>. These rulesets can be invoked with `--rules=`, and of course `default` is used by default. You can also create your own custom rulesets.</p>

<p>Remember, linting is more than validaiton, so these rules will do more than simply make sure your files
    are valid. They'll make your specs better than valid, they'll make them useful.</p>

<div class="panel panel-default">
    <h3 id="set-default" class="panel-title">Default</h3>
    <div class="well">$ speccy lint openapi.yaml --rules=default</div>
    {% include rules-list.html rules=site.data.rules.default %}
</div>

<div class="panel panel-default">
    <h3 id="set-strict" class="panel-title">Strict</h3>
    <div class="well">$ speccy lint openapi.yaml --rules=strict</div>
    {% include rules-list.html rules=site.data.rules.strict %}
</div>

<p>You can also create your own rulesets with a simple `.json` file.</p>
