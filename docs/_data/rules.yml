    description: "parameter objects should have a description"
    more: |
      Descriptions help human beings understand what sort of value a property should have, beyond the
      obvious type and format. If the field is `distance` and the format is `float`, you can tell the
      reader if that field is meant to be kilometers, meters, feet, inches, miles, or yards. Same goes
      for currency, is this Pounds Sterling or Yen?

  - name:  "operation-operationId"
    object: "operation"
    description: "operation should have an operationId"
    more: |
      Each operation should have an operationId, which is helpful for referencing the operation later.

      Some documentation systems will use it for the URL, meaning folks are going to share links to that
      operation. If you add an operationId later, it'll break that URL, so best to create one as early as
      possible.

  - name:  "operation-summary-or-description"
    object: "operation"
    description: "operation should have summary or description"
    more: |
      A summary (short) or description (longer) help humans understand what this operation is meant to be
      doing. Without explaining it for a human, they have to guess, and guessing leads to unexpected outcomes.

  - name:  "operation-tags"
    object: "operation"
    description: "operation should have non-empty tags array"
    more: |
      Documentation systems use tags for grouping navigation, which is especially useful for larger APIs. Tags
      can be defined in the top level `tags` object, and the operations `tags` array is simply a list of tag names.

      ```
      openapi: 3.0.1

      tags:
        - name: Pokèmon

      paths:
        /pokemons:
          get:
            operationId: get-pokemons
            tags:
              - Pokèmon
      ```

  - name: "server-trailing-slash"
    object: "server"
    description: "server url should not have a trailing slash"
    more: |
      The `url` in the server object should not have a trailing slash, because that `/` is actually rhe first
      character of the path. Having it in both places will confuse some vendor tooling and you might see `//`
      showing up in the full URL.

      **Good**

      ```
      servers:
        - url: https://example.org/api
      ```

      **Bad**

      ```
      servers:
        - url: https://example.org/api/
      ```

  - name:  "openapi-tags"
    object: "openapi"
    description: "openapi object should have non-empty tags array"
    more: |
      Documentation systems use tags for grouping navigation, which is especially useful for larger APIs. Although
      tags can be defined on the fly in operations without defining them, a top-level `tags` object allows you
      to control the order tags are displayed in many tools.

      Find all of the tags used in various operations, and define them in the top-level `tags` object.

      ```
      openapi: 3.0.1

      tags:
        - name: Gym
        - name: Pokèmon

      paths:
        /pokemons:
          get:
            operationId: get-pokemons
            tags:
              - Pokèmon
        /gyms:
          get:
            operationId: get-gyms
            tags:
              - Gym
      ```

  - name:  "openapi-tags-alphabetical"
    object: "openapi"
    description: "openapi object should have alphabetical tags"
    more: |
      Seeing as some tools render tags in the order they're defined, it's just a Good Idea™ to
      define them in alphabetical order.

  - name:  "reference-no-other-properties"
    object: "reference"
    description: "reference objects should only have a $ref property"
    more: |
      You should avoid having other keywords sat next to a `$ref`, as the OpenAPI
      spec instructs tools to ignore any siblings. Due to that, putting things is
      not only going against the spec, but it's pointless, and potentially confusing
      to people reading the files. It may also trigger errors in some validators.

  - name:  "example-value-or-externalValue"
    object: "example"
    description: "example should have either value or externalValue"
    more: |
      You can use the `value` keywords or the `externalValue` keyword, but you can't use both!

  - name: "no-script-tags-in-markdown"
    object: "*"
    description: "markdown descriptions should not contain script tags"
    more: |
      Putting script tags in markdown descriptions is a recipe for disaster, as it might
      try to run arbitrary JavaScript on documentation views, or who knows what else.

      If the specs were written come from an untrusted source, this would be considered a
      security concern.

  - name: "info-contact"
    object: "info"
    description: "info object should contain contact object"
    more: |
      Users of your API should be able to contact you, so put your contact information in
      the info object.

      ``` yaml
      openapi: 3.0.1
      info:
        contact:
        name: API Support
        url: http://www.example.com/support
        email: support@example.com
      ```

  - name: "license-apimatic-bug"
    object: "license"
    description: "license url should not point at gruntjs"
    more: |
      There was a funny little bug with the Apimatic Transformer a while back where all
      transformed OpenAPI specifications would have the license set to MIT with a URL to
      the license file in the gruntjs repository.

      This was fixed, but if you have that floating around in your spec you probably want
      to point that somewhere else.

      **Good**

      ```
      info:
        license:
          url: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
      ```

      **Bad**

      ```
      info:
        license:
          url: http://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT
      ```

  - name: "no-eval-in-descriptions"
    object: "*"
    description: "markdown descriptions should not contain 'eval('"
    more: |
      Letting specification authors eval random code is proabably a Bad Idea™.

strict:
  - name: "contact-properties"
    object: "contact"
    description: "contact object should have name, url and email"
    more: >
        To make contact info the most useful, all of the options should be used. Including
        a URL and an email address means the user has the most options to be able to get
        in touch, maybe including a URL to your slack channel, or to a support portal,
        and the email could be a team/company address to avoid having a single human as a
        bottleneck.

  - name: "license-url"
    object: "license"
    description: "license object should include url"
    more: >
        Having a license is generally a helpful idea, it lets potential users know how
        they are allowed to leverage your API. Pick one from this [great list](https://opensource.org/licenses),
        anywhere else, or make your own and link to it.

  - name: "server-not-example.com"
    object: "server"
    description: "server url should not point at example.com"
    more: >
        You can do better than example.com! Set up at least a [mock server](http://openapi.tools/#mock),
        maybe even a sandbox, or an actual implementation for users to play with.

  - name: "tag-description"
    object: "tag"
    description: "tag object should have a description"
    more: |
        Adding descriptions to tags is a great way to explain business logic for the concept.

        Often specifications will explain that there is a POST /foos and that creates a foo, and
        there is a GET /foos which gets a bunch of foos, but nobody really explains what a Foo is
        at any point.

        ```
        openapi: 3.0.1
        tags:
            - name: Foo
              description: |
                Multiple lines of text explain all about the concept of a foo in this system, how
                they might related to other items, what sort of stage in the workflow are they
                created, etc.

                You can even put *markdown* in here!
        ```
